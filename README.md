About FoodShala:
This website contains two types of users: Restaurants and Customers. 
Different Registration and Login pages for Customers and Restaurants.
An option on navbar which is "Order Now" is accessible by anyone and everyone. That link will open up all the Restaurants and and on clicking on the specific Restaurant link will open its Menu Page.
Customer:
If a Customer is not logged in then, he/she can not order anything from any Restraunt (session is used to check whether the user has logged in or not). Also, if the user is not logged in then, a link to Login will be displayed on the screen else not.
The Customer after logging in can order the items from the Restaurants.
Restaurants:
The Admin of the Restaurant can login can see the its Restaurant's Menu and has the access to edit the detail of any item such as its price. 
The Admin also has the View orders by clicking on the "View Orders" link and can check the details of all the users who have anything from his/her Restaurant. For example: If "Cake House" Admin has logged in, he/she can check the number of users who have ordered, the number of items and its corresponding quantity.
